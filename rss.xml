            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Obstacle is the way</h1><p>I like Ryan Holiday. I admire and look up to him despite his young age and often wonder how he has managed to accomplish so much in such a short time.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/538a66fada666b044f8f201b4031e2eff8ca9862.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Outliers</h1><p>I really loved this book. I had heard people refer to it as the "10000 hour rule" book (Gladwell suggests in his book that 10000 hours of practice in any field are a necessary pre-condition to achieve mastery in pretty much any field), but I found it to be much more than that: I would say that his main argument is rather that opportunity is the number one predictor of success.Â </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/44dc4a59cc12fef688724a4754c292f3c62a01e0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

I like Ryan Holiday. I admire and look up to him despite his young age and often wonder how he has managed to accomplish so much in such a short time.

He runs a [kick-ass newsletter][0] with monthly book recommendations: I love the great books he recommends but also that it is such a great reminder to continue reading and learning. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d7de499a-3803-4bb2-91f0-2a4f8c16f4c1.jpg)

This book is full of great and often fun stories on how great people persevered when things looked the grimmest and how they managed to turn disadvantages into advantages. It has been a few weeks since I finished it, and more than specific advice, what I got out of it was a new mindset more than specific advice: a mindset of not being discouraged by adversity, of thinking creatively about how to overcome obstacles rather than giving up, of endurance and perseverance.

I also enjoyed the interview at the end of the audiobook (ibooks) with Tim Ferris. I must say thought that as much as I like the things Tim Ferris talks about in general, and as much as I've enjoyed his books, I find him excruciatingly painful to listen too: he must be the deepest shallow person on earth, with seemingly incredible knowledge about a ton of things but carried with the shallowest demeanour imaginable. Anyway, the interview is great because some of Ryan's answers to Tim's questions are pure gold.

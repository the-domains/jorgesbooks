I really loved this book. I had heard people refer to it as the "10000 hour rule" book (Gladwell suggests in his book that 10000 hours of practice in any field are a necessary pre-condition to achieve mastery in pretty much any field), but I found it to be much more than that: I would say that his main argument is rather that opportunity is the number one predictor of success. 

I found his arguments about culture (as in the culture they come from) being another important aspect of success fascinating, but he also places a lot of emphasis on effort (paired with opportunity, of course).

I (mostly) listened to this one via the Audio Book read by Gladwell himself and thoroughly enjoyed it.
